# Housing

Each SoundNet device consists of a 4 channel SoundTrap, a sensor pacakage and an outer housing which holds the hydrophones and sensor package in place. The outer housing is made up of three 3D printed parts which fit together over the SoundTrap and sensor package and kept in place with stainless steel bolts.

The three .stl files here can be 3D printed easily on a local printer or using a service. The material should be rated for the marine environment and should be suitable for the intricate construction of the hydrophone frame.
